    <p>
      Tim glanced at the stations main building. Many people were standing are the big glass windows, staring at the chasm and Tim.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked past all of the fallen pumps and pieces of the roof. As he stood at the edge of the road, he had no need to look both ways, for any car on the street had either fallen off or stopped moving. 
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the road, and stared at the gaping chasm seperating the land. He crouched down, and saw water beneath the crack. He looked to his left and to his right, and saw that it extended as far as the eye could see.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked closer, he noticed that the hole seemed to be getting wider. He wasn't sure what was happening, and neither was anyone else. He decided that he had seen enough, and that he was hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the gas station, he noted that the people seemed to be scared of him. He wasn't sure why, and neither are the people. They just haven't seen him before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heads towards the chip aisle, where he intends to buy some Lays. However, all of the Lays are out, and so are most other chip brands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is furious, and runs to the cashier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "WHERE ARE THE FUCKING LAYS!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Settle down, ma'am. We sold out of em' yesterday. The truck was supposed to come today, but got stopped for unknown reasons. We could getcha another brand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another brand of chip. Tim had never heard anything so utterly proposterous in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another brand of chip! I have never heard anything so utterly proposteroius in my whole life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry sir. It's the best ya gonna get."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, a loud noise occurs on the TV hanging in the top left corner of the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This just in-New Jersey has been seperated from the mainland U.S.A."
    </p>
    <p>
      'SEPERATED' The whole crowd exclaims. Tim sees people on the Pennsylvania side of the border waving to them. He finds it amusing, and he wants to talk to them to see their opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He steps out of the store, and asks, "Howdy folk. I see y'all are from the keystone state! How d'ya think about the whole situation we's in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They are utterly silent. "Sorry. That's not how I normally speak. My name's Tim. Tim Loveheart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      He doesn't realize it yet, but they are talking to him. They are waving and shouting, "Hello. Sir. SIR" He can't hear them because they are so far away.
