      Chapter 1: The Incident
    </h1>
    <p>
      "I'm gonna be late!" Tim Loveheart thinks to himself. He is a resident of Sommersville, New York, about an hour out from his job as the mayor of Newarks financial advisor. He has to do this commute every morning, and stay from 9am-10pm. You may think, "Why doesn't he just purchase a house there?" Well, despite being a financial advisor, he is fundamentally broke. He has only 200 bucks and a couple of bottle caps to his name. He essentially lives off his parents. Anyways, today started off as any other normal day had. He woke up, had his cereal, got dressed, brushed his teeth, and hopped in his car. About 40 minutes into his journey, he ran out of gas, right on the border. Since he was in Jersey, he stopped at the local Wawa and got someone else to pump it for him. It's a law there you know. 
      "All the way, please!" Directed Tim, to which the pumper replies,
      "My name is Todd. With two d's, but one is silent."
      He is a white man in his mid 20's with noir hair and deep green eyes. He is cleanly shaven, and he is fairly skinny. He has his hair in an afro, which he usually only has up on Tuesdays, but todays a Wednesday, and he forgot to change it. Silly him. He is wearing the mandatory WaWa uniform, which this specific location forces you to wear. 
      Tim mumbles, and asks, "How's life?"
      "I don't know you."
      The two of them fall silent.
      Suddenly, the pump starts shaking, and Todd falls to the floor. 
      "Shit-!" 
      "Hey, Tod-, what's happening! An earthquake!?"
      "Damnit! It's Todd! TODD!"
      The gas pump that was in Tim's car flys out like a loose hose, directed right at Todd's mouth. It hits him at full speed, knocking out his front teeth and shattering his jaw. Gas spills into him fixed-open mouth.
      "MhmMhMhmhhmH!!!!"
      "What in the SHIT!" 
      Tim sees land and rock flying out of the ground in the distance. He still thinks that it is an earthquake. While Tim is fixed out the flying materials, Todd is drowning in gas. It has filled up his whole mouth at this point, and is spewing out his eyes, mouth, and ears. Suddenly, his eyes go bloodshot, and he lets out a loud,
      "MMHMHMHM"
      He is now dead. Tim stares at his dead body, with gas still filling him up, and realizes that the earthquake is over. 
      "What was that!?"
      He hops out of his car, and takes a look around. He takes one last look at Todd's body, before taking the pump back out and putting it in his car.
      "Hey you!" Screamed a guy hopping out of his car. He was a 50 year old American man, with a big bushy gray beard and an American flag bandana, shirt, pants, and even underwear and socks, which were very prominent.
      "Didja cause this! Cuz ya look like it!" He laughed at his own joke, which was very ironic due to the fact that Tim is about 200 pounds lighter than this guy.
      "I'm only jokin' wit ya! The name's Crawford. Call me Craw. Or Ford. BUT DON'T YOU FFFFUCKIN DARE CALL ME AWFORD!"
      "Ok, A W F O R D."
      Tim likes to push people's buttons. Unfortunately, this guys buttons were a little too sensitive, so he hopped in his truck, and put the pedal to the metal. Craw went full speed at Tim. However, once Ford reached Todd's body, his tire popped. He must've rolled over one of Todd's many spike collars that he had on his neck. Tim couldn't see this becuase of a mandatory turtleneck the employees have to wear. The truck skid to a stop, exploding Todd, sending a mixture of gas, blood, and organs flying directly at Tim. He is blinded by the concoction, but hears something unusual.
      "SHIT! I FALLING BACKWARD!" Craw, was indeed, falling backwards. His 5000 ton truck, with an American flag on it, was falling backwards at very fast speeds. This was due to the chasm caused by the "earthquake". He had time to get out of his car, but he was too busy fixing his bandana and hair. He, and his truck, flew into the chasm, never to be seen again. Tim brushed himself off, and pulled the gas pump out of his car. Most of the other cars in the lot had falling off aswell, but he was unaware of that. All he knew was that he needed to find out the cause of this incident.
